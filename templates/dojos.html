  <p>Coding Dojoâ€™s founder, Michael Choi, served as partner and CEO of several successful startups including a real estate lead-gen company called Zurple. It was a high-growth startup and Michael was struggling to find qualified developers so he created a training program of his own. Not only did he believe this to be more pragmatic and efficient, but Michael also loved to teach.</p>
